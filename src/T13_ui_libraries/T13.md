# UI Libraries

---

# Why?

> "Normally-expected" UI design and UI functionality take a lot of work to make.

---

# Dropdown

- [DIY](https://codepen.io/taylorharwood/pen/EggMOO)
- [Library](https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/primitives/components/dropdown-menu)
- [WAI-ARIA Standard](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/menubar/)

---

# We want to

- Spend more time on business logic, not UI design and UI logic.
- Establish common framework for collaboration.
- Have maintainable and extensible system.

# Types

| Library Type         | CSS/Theme | Functionality |
| -------------------- | --------- | ------------- |
| "Style"              | ✅        | ❌            |
| "Component"          | ✅        | ✅            |
| "Headless-Component" | ❌        | ✅            |
| "Anti-Component"     | ✅        | ✅            |

# Consideration

- Ease of use
  - How much code do I need to write?
- Customizability
  - How much can I change down the line?
- Inclusiveness
  - Do I need to install extra things?
- Look and feel
  - Does it make my app look generic?

---

_Most importantly_

> # Does it support a dark mode?

---

# Disclaimer

- The choices of UI libraries can be opionated.
- At the end of the day, you must choose your own path.
- Anything marked with 🦀 is my opinion. You don't have to take it.

---

# "Style" libraries

---

# "Style" lirary

- _No library_
- `Styled-Components`
- `Tailwind CSS`
- `Classless`

---

# No library

- `global.css`
  - Good for `font-family`, `background-color`, CSS variables, CSS reset.
- CSS Module
  - Allow same class names without conflict.
- Inline CSS
  - Can be used as a one-time fix.

---

# No library

- Good
  - Pure CSS (💪)
- Bad
  - 🦀 Separation between style and content
- Dark mode
  - OK, but can potentially be time consuming.
  - Need to implement own hook.

---

# Styled Component

> Styling your way with speed, strong typing, and flexibility.

- Styled components are a CSS-in-JS tool that bridges the gap between components and styling.

- Installation note
  - For NextJS, follow the [instructions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/css-in-js#styled-components).

---

# Styled Component

- Good
  - CSS-in-JS
  - Full customizability from pure CSS
- Bad
  - 🦀 CSS-in-JS in separate file (anyway)
  - 🦀 Hard to maintain.

---

# Tailwind CSS

> Rapidly build modern websites without ever leaving your HTML

- A utility-first CSS framework
  - Provides several of opinionated, single-purpose utility classes that you can use directly inside your markup.
- [Tailwind founder's keynote](https://youtu.be/CLkxRnRQtDE)

---

# Tailwind CSS

- Good
  - Styling in markup
  - 🦀 Less customizability than pure CSS
  - 🦀 Maintainable: _(3 months from now, I can come back and quickly adjust style.)_
- Bad
  - Need to learn syntax
  - Ugly markup
    - Fix: Use VSCode extension or wrap markup in components.

---

# Classless

- These libraries generally do not define classes.
- Instead, they automatically style raw HTML structure
  - Based on HTML tag semantics.
- Examples
  - [PicoCSS](https://picocss.com/)
  - [More examples](https://github.com/dbohdan/classless-css)

---

# Classless

- Good
  - Effortless
- Bad
  - Less customizable.
- Dark mode
  - Not supported 😡 (some libraries)

---

# "Component" lirary

- `Bootstrap React`
- `Mantine`
- Others
  - `Material UI`
  - `Chakra UI`
  - `Ant Design`

---

# Bootstrap React

> The most popular front-end framework, rebuilt for React.

---

# Bootstrap React

- Good
  - Lots of premade components
  - Provided CSS bootrap classes
- Bad
  - Hard to customize
  - 🦀 Bootstrap classes are verbose.
  - 🦀 Look "Bootstrap"

---

# Mantine

> Build fully functional accessible web applications faster than ever – Mantine includes more than 100 customizable components and 50 hooks to cover you in any situation

---

# Wow...

- [Color generator](https://mantine.dev/colors-generator/)
  - Try changing color in `App.tsx`.
- [Color-scheme hook](https://mantine.dev/theming/color-schemes/)
- [Mantine UI](https://ui.mantine.dev/)

---

# Mantine

- Good
  - Comprehensive lists of components (seriously)
  - Comes with useful hooks
  - 🦀 No CSS class
    - You can use other CSS style libraries (e.g. `Tailwind CSS`)
- Bad
  - 🦀 some frictions when trying to deeply customize.
- Dark mode
  - Ready

---

---

# "Headless-Component" libraries

---

> Unstyled, accessible components for building high‑quality design systems and web apps in React.

---

# Radix UI

- Good
  - Fully customization (design)
  - Excellent functionality
- Bad
  - Too much code for simple stuffs

---

# "Anti-Component" libraries

---

# "Anti-Component" libraries

> This is NOT a component library. It's a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

- `Flowbite`
- `shadcn/ui`

---

# Flowbite

> Build websites even faster with components on top of Tailwind CSS

---

# shadcn/ui
