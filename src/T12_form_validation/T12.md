# Form and validation

Is your app safe?

---

http://10.10.12.140:5176
http://10.10.12.140:5175/api-docs

---

# Let's make sure your app is safe from

- Data from API call
- User input

---

# Wait, but I thought I used `TypeScript`.

- TypeScript catches compile-time errors.
- We are talking about **run-time** errors.

---

# Validation library

- `Zod`
- `Yup`
- `Typebox`

---

# Task 1: Validating API

---

# User server

### Local

- Clone https://github.com/fullstack-66/user-server
- `npm install`, `npm start`
- `http://localhost:3001`

### Cloud

- https://user-server-production-f0b7.up.railway.app

---

# Task

- Inspect `User` data from `/users` and `/users_wrong`. Notice
  - Key differences
  - Calendar year difference
- Let's make sure your app can detect and handle these differences at run-time.
- Solution

# Setting up NextJS

`./tsconfig.json`

```json
{
  // ...
  "baseUrl": ".",
  "paths": {
    "@components/*": ["components/*"],
    "@app/*": ["app/*"]
  }
}
```

---

# Remove Tailwind preflight

`./app/globals.css`

```css
/* @tailwind base; */
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

---

# API URL

`./utils/index.ts`

```ts
if (!process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL) {
  throw new Error("NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL is not set");
}
const API_URL = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL;
export const URL_DATA = `${API_URL}/users`;
export const URL_DATA_WRONG = `${API_URL}/users_wrong`;
```

---

# Install

- `npm install zod zustand axios`

---

# Task 2: Validating user input

Using vanilla React

---

# Endpoints

### POST `/users`

- Create user
  - I intentionally throttled the server.

```json
{
  "firstName": "Vince",
  "lastName": "Romaguera",
  "email": "Albert_Von@gmail.com",
  "dateOfBirth": "2022-8-1",
  "password": "12345",
  "confirmPassword": "12345"
}
```

---

# Endpoints

### GET `/reset `

- Reset data

---

# Install

- `npm install react-modal`
- `npm install -D @faker-js/faker`

---

# Form UX improvement

- "Real-time" validation
- Prevent submission if input is not valid.
- Prevent double submission.
- Prevent typing during submission.
- Auto-focus the wrong input.

---

# Real-time validation

- Use `useEffect` to trigger schema validation
- Store errors in `errors` state.
- Keep track of when user touches the form.
  - Prevent premature validation.
  - Store `touch` state

---

# Form disable

- Keep track of `valid` state.
- Keep track of `submission` state.

---

# Spiral out of control

- Too many states
- Too many logics
- Not reusable

---

# Form library

- Help you handle form states and logics in a reusable manner.

  - It is essentially a custom hook.
  - Integrates seemlessly with validation library.

- Popular libraries
  - `Formik`
  - `React Hook Form`

---

# Install

- `npm install react-hook-form @hookform/resolvers @hookform/error-message`
