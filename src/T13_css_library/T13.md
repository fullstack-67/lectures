# UI Libraries

---

# Why?

> "Normally-expected" UI design and UI functionality take a lot of work to make.

---

# Dropdown

- [DIY](https://codepen.io/taylorharwood/pen/EggMOO)
- [Library](https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/primitives/components/dropdown-menu)
- [WAI-ARIA Standard](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/menubar/)

# We want to

- Spend more time on business logic, not UI design and UI logic.
- Establish common framework for collaboration.
- Have maintainable and extensible system.

# Types

| Library Type         | CSS/Theme | Functionality |
| -------------------- | --------- | ------------- |
| "Style"              | ✅        | ❌            |
| "Component"          | ✅        | ✅            |
| "Headless-Component" | ❌        | ✅            |

# Consideration

- Ease of use
  - How much code do I need to write?
- Customizability
  - How much can I change down the line?
- Inclusiveness
  - Do I need to install extra things?
- Look and feel
  - Does it make my app look generic?

---

# Disclaimer

- The choices of UI libraries can be opionated.
- At the end of the day, you must choose your own path.
- Anything marked with 🦀 is my opinion. You don't have to take it.

---

# "Style" libraries

---

# "Style" lirary

- _No library_
- `Styled-Components`
- `Tailwind CSS`

---

# No library

- `globals.css`
  - Not recommended
- Inline CSS
  - Can be used as a quick fix
- CSS Module

---

# CSS Module

- Good
  - No name conflicts
  - Separation between style and content
- Bad
  - 🦀 Separation between style and content

---

# Styled Component

> Styling your way with speed, strong typing, and flexibility.

- Styled components are a CSS-in-JS tool that bridges the gap between components and styling.

- Installation note
  - For NextJS, follow the [instructions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/css-in-js#styled-components).

---

# Styled Component

- Good
  - CSS-in-JS
  - Full customizability from pure CSS
- Bad
  - 🦀 CSS-in-JS in separate file (anyway)
  - 🦀 Hard to maintain.

---

# Tailwind CSS

> Rapidly build modern websites without ever leaving your HTML

- A utility-first CSS framework
  - Provides several of opinionated, single-purpose utility classes that you can use directly inside your markup.
- [Tailwind founder's keynote](https://youtu.be/CLkxRnRQtDE)

---

# Tailwind CSS

- Good
  - Styling in markup
  - 🦀 Less customizability than pure CSS
  - 🦀 Maintainable: _(3 months from now, I can come back and quickly adjust style.)_
- Bad
  - Need to learn syntax
  - Ugly markup
    - Fix: Use VSCode extension or wrap markup in components.

---

# "Component" lirary

---

# "Component" lirary

- `Bootstrap React`
- `Mantine`
